## Hi! I am Arthur.
My name is Arthur Pacaud and I'm a hobbyist developer.  
I contribute a lot to the open source project GDevelop but am also interested in other projects.

## My projects:
I currently work on PRs and extensions for the open source game engine GDevelop.  
I also have side projects connected to GDevelop like gdmod, a modding API and mod loader for any GDevelop game.

### Frameworks/languages I like:
- I like frameworks on top of react like react-create-app or Gatsby.
- My favorite languages are JavaScript and python for their development speed, especially JavaScript for it's flexibility.
- I also like C++ and Java.
- I don't like lua and gdscript.
- I don't like jQuery.

### About me:
I was born Paris. I currently am 15 and at highschool in Bonn (Germany).
When not programming, I like moderating chats or forums and cooking (even though I am not skilled at it ðŸ˜…).
I really like open source software and will try to contribute more to it in the future.
