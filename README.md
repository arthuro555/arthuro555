My name is Arthur Pacaud and I'm a hobbyist developer.  
I contribute a lot to the open source project [GDevelop](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop) but I am also interested in other projects.

## My projects:
I currently work on PRs and extensions for the open source game engine GDevelop.  
I make some bindings to native APIs in JavaScript, like [cordova-webshare-api](https://github.com/arthuro555/cordova-webshare-api).  
I also have side projects connected to GDevelop like [gdmod](https://github.com/arthuro555/gdmod), a modding API and mod loader for any GDevelop game.

### Tools I like:
- I like frameworks on top of react like create-react-app or Gatsby.
- My favorite language is TypeScript for its development speed and flexibility.
- I also like C++ and Python.

### About me:
I was born Paris. I currently am 16 and at highschool in Bonn (Germany).
When not programming, I like moderating chats or forums and cooking (even though I am not skilled at it ðŸ˜…).
I really like open source software and will try to contribute more to it in the future.
