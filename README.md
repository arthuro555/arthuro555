My name is Arthur Pacaud and I'm a hobbyist developer :wave:

## My projects:

My main project is currently [THNK, an open source, full-fledged, and high performance multiplayer game framework for GDevelop](https://thnk.arthuro555.com).
Most of my contributions to open source are around the open source no-/low-code game engine GDevelop.  

A few other projects I am proud of:  
 - [gdmod](https://github.com/arthuro555/gdmod), a modding API and mod loader for any GDevelop game.
 - [gdexporter](https://github.com/arthuro555/gdexporter), a CLI exporter for GDevelop games.
 - [cloud-gdjs](https://github.com/arthuro555/cloud-gdjs), a cloud-ready runtime for GDevelop games, that removes all rendering code.

 A few discontinued projects that were very interesting and enriching to build:
 - [node-discord-game-sdk](https://github.com/arthuro555/node-discord-game-sdk), a node native module made with C++ to interact with discord using their game SDK.
 - [create-project-state](https://github.com/arthuro555/create-project-state), a framework agnostic, reactive and fully typesafe state management library for editors built in TypeScript.
 - [cordova-webshare-api](https://github.com/arthuro555/cordova-webshare-api), a cordova plugin to add a spec-compliant WebShare API implementation to cordova's android platform.
 
And finally, my numerous extensions and examples for GDevelop:

## Tools I like:

- I believe JSX is the ultimate templating method ðŸ˜¤
- My favorite language is TypeScript, as it allows for great flexibility while still letting one move fast without breaking things.
- I sometimes use C++ and Python.
- I am getting really into kubernetes ðŸ˜Ž It's a very interesting tool!
- I am meaning to start learning rust and elixir seriously.

### About me:

I was born in Paris. I currently am 17 and at highschool in Bonn (Germany).
I plan to try and get into the [KIT University](https://www.kit.edu/) after graduating from highschool.
When not programming, I help moderating a few communities and I also like cooking (even though I am not skilled at it ðŸ˜…).
I really like open source software. Although I do not contribute to many software aside from GDevelop, I have plenty of my own ðŸ’ª
