My name is Evelyne "arthuro555" Pacaud and I'm a software developer :wave:

## My projects:

My main project is currently [THNK, an open source, full-fledged, and high performance multiplayer game framework for GDevelop](https://thnk.cloud).
Most of my contributions to open source are around the open source no-/low-code game engine GDevelop.  

A few other projects I am proud of:  
 - [gdmod](https://github.com/arthuro555/gdmod), a modding API and mod loader for any GDevelop game.
 - [gdexporter](https://github.com/arthuro555/gdexporter), a CLI exporter for GDevelop games.
 - [cloud-gdjs](https://github.com/arthuro555/cloud-gdjs), a cloud-ready runtime for GDevelop games, that removes all rendering code.

 A few discontinued projects that were very interesting and enriching to build:
 - [node-discord-game-sdk](https://github.com/arthuro555/node-discord-game-sdk), a node native module made with C++ to interact with discord using their game SDK.
 - [create-project-state](https://github.com/arthuro555/create-project-state), a framework agnostic, reactive and fully typesafe state management library for editors built in TypeScript.
 - [cordova-webshare-api](https://github.com/arthuro555/cordova-webshare-api), a cordova plugin to add a spec-compliant WebShare API implementation to cordova's android platform.
 
And finally, my numerous extensions and examples for GDevelop:

## Tools I like:

- My favorite languages are Rust & TypeScript.
- I believe JSX is the ultimate templating method ðŸ˜¤
- I love Kubernetes!
- I love working on complex, local-first, and accessible frontends âœ¨

### About me:

I was born in Paris. I grew up in Germany, and now I'm 20 and dropped out of my Bachelors at [KIT University](https://www.kit.edu/).
When not programming, I help moderating a few communities, I host and maintain instances of software for numerous causes, and I actively participate in associations like the [Entropia e.V](https://entropia.de) and [Flux HSG](https://flux-ka.de).
I really like open source software. I contributed a lot to GDevelop, and I made plenty of my own ðŸ’ª
I am a member of Entropia e.V., a regional instance of Germany's Chaos Computer Club and organiser of the GPN.
